      Things to learn/practice:
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <pre>
      - Unix
        - http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
        - Be able to: 
          - explore the filesystem (ls and cd)
          - read files (cat, less, vim, ...)
          - copy, delete, and move files around (cp, mv, rm)
      
      - Vim
        - from the terminal, you can enter: vimtutor
          and go through the tutorial a bit
        - Be able to use: (i)nsert mode, (u)ndo, (d)elete, (:w)rite, (:q)uit

      - Debugging
        - Use Google to search (obvi), results from StackOverflow will usually have good examples
        - copy/paste error strings --> google
        - describe what you're trying to do in as few words as possible --> google
        - if it's system related, prefix your search with something like "unix" or "raspbian" (if using the raspi)
        - python related: add "python" to your search
      
      - Python
        - DECISION: Python 2.7 or Python 3?
          - There is not a huUuuGE difference between the two as far as syntax and writing code goes, so don't feel like
            you're ever "learning the wrong one". Learning one will mostly correlate with learning the other.
          - Python 2.7 is older, which means there are usually more examples and documentation around it.
            A lot of companies/projects are still in the process of migrating their 2.7 code to 3, so you wouldn't be "behind"
            for learning it instead of 3.
          - Python 3 introduces some shiny new features, but most of which you won't have a use for until down the road.
          - I would say start with 2.7 (which I believe is already your default python interpreter, so no extra work needed)
        - When learning anything, it's useful to stop and google/wikipedia search any unfamiliar terms or concepts.
          Just be wary of "rabbit holes". Though, going off on a tangential reading spree is not necessarily a bad thing;
          if you are intrigued by what you're reading and you think it's useful knowledge, keep going down that rabbit hole!
          Just keep checking back with your original topic to make sure you're increasing your understanding of the concept
          you were curious of in the first place.
        - IPython
          - much better interactive python shell (REPL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
        - virtualenv
        - hello.py
